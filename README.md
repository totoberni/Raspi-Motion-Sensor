# Raspi-Motion-Sensor
A student's project to build a motion sensor. The project is supposed to be a challenge for other classmates to try.

## Below is a description to setup the project

## Difficulty: 
Medium

## Prerequisites:
1 PIR (Passive InfraRed) sensor
1 Raspberry Pi Pico
1 Breadboard
4 cables

## Description: 
The task is to build a motion sensor by implementing a MicroPython script on the Raspberry Pi Pico. The script will use the PIR to detect movement and will light a let!
The project can be divided into two tasks : detecting motion and printing an output to the console when that happens, and reading the output from the first file to light an LED.

A skeleton code for each task is provided in the repository, as well as the solutions for each section.
