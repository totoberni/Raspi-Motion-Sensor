# Raspi-Motion-Sensor
A student's project to build a motion sensor. The project is supposed to be a challenge for other classmates to try.

## Below is a description to setup the project

## Difficulty: 
Medium

## Prerequisites:
- Raspberry Pi Pico board
- One PIR Sensor
- One 5mm LED
- One 220 ohm resistor
- Breadboard
- Connecting Wires

## Description: 
The task is to build a motion sensor by implementing a MicroPython script on the Raspberry Pi Pico. The script will use the PIR to detect movement and will light a let!
The project can be divided into two tasks : detecting motion and printing an output to the console when that happens, and reading the output from the first file to light an LED.

A skeleton code for each task is provided in the repository, as well as the solutions for each section.
